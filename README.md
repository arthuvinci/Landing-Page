# LANDING PAGE

This is a solution of The Odin Project challenge to help me improve my skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

## My process

### What I learned

When you look at the code, you can see that I was changing my coding methods throughout, and I did this because as I was creating the Page, I was learning new ways to simplify and achieve my goals.

I learned how to better use Flexbox, how to use lists, and how to link parts of the page with navigation buttons.

### Struggles

I had a lot of difficult in the hole project specialy in the design part( I am used to have a ton of ideias and sometimes lost time in little things)
but this one part in special I would change all of it. But I tried to make it simple so I just let the way it was, what bothers me is that I  exagerade  and didn't reach what I was aimng for, at least it is what I think
